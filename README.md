AWS Lambda Communication via SNS Events across Multiple Accounts

Description:
This Git project provides an example implementation showcasing the communication between two AWS Lambda functions using SNS (Simple Notification Service) events. The scenario presented in this project involves Lambda functions belonging to different AWS accounts, demonstrating cross-account communication.

Features:

AWS Lambda Function Integration: The project demonstrates how to integrate and establish communication between two Lambda functions.
SNS Event Handling: SNS events are utilized as the mechanism for transmitting messages between the Lambda functions.
Cross-Account Communication: The example showcases how to enable communication between Lambda functions located in different AWS accounts.
AWS Cloud Infrastructure: The project provides the necessary infrastructure setup, including the configuration of AWS Lambda and SNS resources.
